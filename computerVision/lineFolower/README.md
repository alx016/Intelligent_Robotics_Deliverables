This code has two options wether work with an image, or work with real time image. Both of them uses computer vision to follow a black line.
It draws 2 lines at the borders of the black line and calculate the middle of both lines and the middle of the whole image. 

The first line Folower code has less exactitud according to the line detecion. While whe second Folower code follows the lines more accordingly. 

The next image is the result of the second code, which works with an image. 
It uses blue lines to cover the black reference. 
The red line is the middle between the 2 blue lines. 
And the green line is the middle of the image.
